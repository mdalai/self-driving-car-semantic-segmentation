# self-driving-car-semantic-segmentation
## Project Introduction
**Project Goal**: classify each pixel in road images into Road or Not Road.

**Project Overview**:
We will use [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) to train a model called [Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf), then using the trained FCN model to classify pixels in test images.

## Dataset Understanding
- Download the dataset in [HERE](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).

Let's see what training image and label look like:

- Road: labeled as PINK.
- Not Road: labeled as RED.
- Image shape:
- Training Data size:
