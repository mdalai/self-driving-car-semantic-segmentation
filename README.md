# self-driving-car-semantic-segmentation
## Project Introduction
**Project goal**: classify each pixel in road images into Road or Not Road.

**Project Overview**:
We will use (Kitti Road dataset)[http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php] to train a model called Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), then using the trained FCN model to classify pixels in test images.
