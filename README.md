# self-driving-car-semantic-segmentation
## Project Introduction
**Project goal**: classify each pixel in road images into Road or Not Road.

**Project Overview**:
We will use [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) to train a model called [Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf), then using the trained FCN model to classify pixels in test images.
